You can then upload this zip file in your AYON instance, on the Bundles (<code>/settings/bundles</code>) section. Make sure you restart the server. AYON should prompt you to do so after uploading.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#server","title":"Server","text":"<p>Once the instance has restarted, you should be able to enable the addon by going into the <code>Settings &gt; Bundles</code> and creating (or duplicating an existing) bundle, where you can now choose <code>shotgrid</code> and the <code>version</code> you installed. Make sure you set the bundle as <code>Production</code>. If the addon loaded successfully, you should be able to see a new tab in your <code>Settings &gt; Shotgrid</code>.</p> <p>For the Shotgrid integration to work, we need to provide several pieces of information. Firstly, we\u2019ll need a Shotgrid Script and its API key. Refer to the Shotgrid Documentation to create one; take note of the information and in AYON, navigate to the <code>Settings &gt; Secrets</code> page. Create a new secret with the <code>script_name</code> as the \"Secret Name\" and the <code>script_api_key</code> as the \"Secret Value\".</p> <p>We can now go into the <code>Settings &gt; Studio settings &gt; Shotgrid</code> page in AYON and fill in the following fields: * Shotgrid URL - This will be the URL to your Shotgrid instance. * Shotgrid API Secret - Select the secret you created in the previous step. * Shotgrid field for the Project Code - A field in the <code>Project</code> entity that holds the project code. It can be an existing one or a new one. The default is <code>code</code>. * Service Settings &gt; How often (in seconds) to query the Shotgrid Database  - Defaults to 10 seconds, the time between <code>leeching</code>, <code>processing</code>, and <code>transmitting</code> operations.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#desktop-application","title":"Desktop application","text":"<p>When launching AYON for the first time, you'll be asked to provide a login (only the username) for Shotgrid. This is the user that will be used for publishing. After providing a login, people can publish normally. The integration will ensure that the user can connect to Shotgrid, has the correct permissions, and will create the Version and PublishedFile in Shotgrid if the publish is successful.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#services","title":"Services","text":"<p>The services are a way to handle operations between AYON and Shotgrid in the background. These have been developed around the AYON Events system. We replicate Shotgrid events (the ones we care about) as AYON <code>shotgrid.event</code>, which then the <code>processor</code> will pick up and process them accordingly. Lastly, the <code>transmitter</code> will look for changes in AYON and attempt to replicate them in Shotgrid. In any case, the Shotgrid project has to have the field \"Ayon Auto Sync\" enabled for the <code>leecher</code> and the <code>transmitter</code> to work. They share code, which is found in <code>shotgrid_common</code>. Most importantly, the <code>AyonShotgridHub</code> is a class that bootstraps common actions when working with AYON and Shotgrid.</p> <p>The three provided services are:</p> <ul> <li><code>processor</code> - This has a set of handlers for different <code>shotgrid.event</code> and acts on them.</li> <li><code>leecher</code> - Periodically queries the <code>EventLogEntry</code> table on Shotgrid and ingests any event that interests us, dispatching it as a <code>shotgrid.event</code>. This will only query projects that have the \"Ayon Auto Sync\" field enabled.</li> <li><code>transmitter</code> - Periodically checks for new events in AYON of topic <code>entity.*</code> and pushes any changes to Shotgrid, only affecting projects that have the \"Ayon Auto Sync\" field enabled.</li> </ul> <p>The most straightforward way to get this up and running is by using ASH (AYON Service Host). After loading the Addon on the server, you should be able to spawn services in the \"Services\" page.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#development","title":"Development","text":"<p>There's a single <code>Makefile</code> at the root of the <code>services</code> folder, which is used to <code>build</code> the Docker images and to run the services locally with the <code>dev</code> target.
